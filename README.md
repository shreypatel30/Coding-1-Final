# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
My website is a general purpose website. It is very generic, yet has a pleasing, modern-looking style. The website consists of a logo, a simple navigation bar, a simple carousel, a more detailed footer, a brief about page, and a short, yet purposeful, contact page. I chose to use images of city skylines as the images in the carousel. The first two slides display New York City's skyline, while the third slide providing a beautiful picture of the Seattle skyline and harbor with Mount Rainier establishing its magnificent presence in the backdrop. The footer is more detailed but contains bare information, as the site doesn't serve any particular purpose. The about page and contact page both contain cards that can be easily copied and pasted to serve as a text and image holder for other purposes or general info.
